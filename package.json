  The objective of this assignment, is to create a simple money tracker for users. Money can be tracked in multiple wallets (accounts), for example, if a user has multiple businesses. When a user's profile is pulled up, it should show a overall balance and all their wallets (accounts) and their respective balances. Drilling down into each wallet (account), should show the detailed transactions of that wallet (account).
  User Flow:
  
  
  A user signs up (no sign in required. Disregard authentication).
  
  
  A user can create wallets.
  
  
  A user can add expenses or incomes to a wallet.
  
  
  A user can view their profile with the summary of wallets and balances. Show overall balance of all wallets and balance of each wallet.
  
  
  A user can drill into each wallet to see balance and transactions.@gmail.com",
